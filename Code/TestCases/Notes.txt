test1: This test case represents the "bad instance of EDF". The time limit is 5, and the optimal solution should be 4. 1-2-3-4-5. The EDF solution is 2, which would be obtained by via the paths 6-7, 8-9.

test2: This test case has 7 vertices with a timelimit of 7. The optimal solution would be 2. 6-7, 1-6 

test3: This is the reverse of test2. This has an optimal solution of 3. 7-6-1, 2-1. 

test4: This test case represents an instance where some edges have both deadlines going in both directions. There are 9 vertices and the timelimit is 9. The optimal solution is 4. 7-6-7-8, 2-3. 

test5: This test case represents an instance where all edges have deadlines going in both directions. There are 6 vertices and the timelimit is 10. The optimal solution is 3. 3-2-3-4.   

test6: This test case is the same graph as test 4, but the deadlines are larger values to produce more interesting results. The timelimit is still 9. The optimal solution is 5. 7-6-7-8-9, 2-3

test7: This test case is the same graph as test 5, but the deadlines are larger values to produce more interesting reults. The timelimit is still 10. The optimal solution is 6. 3-5-3-2-3-4, 6-3 

test8: small instance for testing opt, 3 vertices, timelimit: 8. Optimal solution is 3. 1-2,2-3,1-3
